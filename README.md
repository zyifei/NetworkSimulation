My research in social media influential ability by network simulation. 


In the real world, we humans interact with each other at various fronts, in person,
through a phone call, text messages, social media, emails, and many other ways. Through
the impact of the conversations, everybody accepts influence from their friends in the
network, to a degree. Let us also make an assumption that the information that our agents
will be exchanging is about a single real number between 0 and 1.
Based on the influence rule above, we can make a further investigation, about how
individual influence other people in a friend circle network, and what potential impact
factors in a social network can decide individual’s influential ability? The influencer
always has a solid attitude and other’s attitude influenced by the people they know.
